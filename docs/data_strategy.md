# Data Strategy

## Data Sources
1. Primary Sources:
   - arXiv papers (CS, ML, AI categories)
   - PubMed Central open access articles
   - Scientific papers with Creative Commons licenses
   - Academic conference proceedings

2. Training Data Requirements:
   - Minimum 100,000 paper-summary pairs
   - Diverse subject matter coverage
   - Multiple writing styles and formats
   - Various paper lengths and complexities

## Data Collection
1. Automated Collection:
   - API integration with academic databases
   - Web scraping with proper permissions
   - Bulk downloads from open access repositories

2. Manual Collection:
   - Expert-created summaries
   - Peer-reviewed paper-summary pairs
   - Quality-controlled datasets

## Data Processing Pipeline
1. PDF Processing:
   ```python
   # High-level pipeline structure
   class PaperProcessor:
       def extract_text(self, pdf_path):
           # Extract raw text from PDF
           pass

       def parse_sections(self, text):
           # Identify paper sections
           pass

       def extract_citations(self, text):
           # Extract and format citations
           pass

       def clean_text(self, text):
           # Remove artifacts and normalize text
           pass
   ```

2. Text Preprocessing:
   - Remove headers and footers
   - Clean special characters
   - Normalize formatting
   - Handle mathematical equations
   - Process tables and figures

3. Citation Handling:
   - Extract citation contexts
   - Maintain reference links
   - Format according to standards
   - Create citation graph

## Data Quality Assurance
1. Validation Checks:
   - Content completeness
   - Citation accuracy
   - Format consistency
   - Language detection
   - Technical term preservation

2. Quality Metrics:
   - Text extraction accuracy
   - Citation matching score
   - Section identification accuracy
   - Format preservation rate

3. Manual Review Process:
   - Expert validation of samples
   - Error analysis and correction
   - Feedback loop implementation

## Privacy and Ethics
1. Data Protection:
   - Compliance with licensing terms
   - Author attribution preservation
   - Personal information handling
   - Secure storage and access

2. Ethical Considerations:
   - Fair use compliance
   - Bias detection and mitigation
   - Transparency in processing
   - Attribution preservation

## Storage and Version Control
1. Data Storage:
   - Raw data in object storage
   - Processed data in document store
   - Metadata in relational database
   - Version control for datasets

2. Access Control:
   - Role-based access
   - Audit logging
   - Usage tracking
   - Data lineage

## Monitoring and Maintenance
1. Data Quality Monitoring:
   - Automated quality checks
   - Distribution drift detection
   - Error rate tracking
   - Performance metrics

2. Maintenance Schedule:
   - Regular data updates
   - Quality review cycles
   - Storage optimization
