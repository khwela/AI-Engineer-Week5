# Problem Definition: AI-Powered Academic Paper Summarization

## Problem Statement
Academic researchers and students face challenges in efficiently processing and understanding large volumes of research papers. Manual summarization is time-consuming and may miss critical information. An AI-powered summarization system can help address these challenges by automatically generating accurate, concise summaries while preserving key information and citations.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Extract key information from academic papers in PDF format
2. Generate concise summaries of variable length (short, medium, long)
3. Preserve and properly format citations
4. Support multiple languages (initially English, with extensibility)
5. Maintain semantic accuracy of technical content
6. Identify and highlight key findings and methodology

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Response time < 5 seconds for papers up to 20 pages
2. 95% uptime
3. Support concurrent users (minimum 100 simultaneous requests)
4. Maintain data privacy and security
5. Scale horizontally for increased load

## Success Criteria
1. ROUGE scores > 0.4 for generated summaries
2. Human evaluation score > 4/5 for summary quality
3. Citation accuracy > 95%
4. User satisfaction rating > 4/5
5. System response time within specified limits

## Stakeholders
1. Primary Users:
   - Academic researchers
   - Students
   - Research institutions

2. Secondary Users:
   - Journal editors
   - Conference organizers
   - Research librarians

3. System Administrators:
   - DevOps team
   - ML Engineers
   - Support staff

## Constraints
1. Computing Resources:
   - GPU memory limitations
   - Storage capacity for model weights
   - Processing time constraints

2. Technical Limitations:
   - PDF parsing accuracy
   - Language model context window size
   - Model size vs. performance trade-offs

3. Business Constraints:
   - Development timeline
   - Resource allocation
   - Budget limitations

## Risk Analysis
1. Technical Risks:
   - Model hallucination
   - Information loss in summarization
   - System downtime

2. Business Risks:
   - Competition from existing solutions
   - Changes in academic publishing standards
   - User adoption challenges

3. Mitigation Strategies:
   - Robust testing and validation
   - Regular model updates
   - User feedback incorporation
   - Continuous monitoring and improvement

## Timeline
1. Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):
   - Initial development and basic functionality
   - Core model implementation

2. Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4):
   - Enhanced features
   - Testing and validation

3. Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6):
   - Deployment and scaling
   - User feedback and iterations

4. Phase 4 (Week 7):
   - Documentation and final adjustments
   - Performance optimization
