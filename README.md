## Problem Statement
We will implement an AI-powered text summarization system that can generate concise, accurate summaries of academic papers. This project demonstrates the complete AI development lifecycle while addressing real-world challenges in academic research.

## Key Features
1. Automated extraction of key information from academic papers
2. Context-aware summarization
3. Citation preservation
4. Multi-language support
5. Customizable summary length
